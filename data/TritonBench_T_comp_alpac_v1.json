Default: `None`.\nMath: A = LL^{\\text{H}} where L is a lower triangular matrix with real positive diagonal and L^{\\text{H}} is the conjugate transpose when L is complex, and the transpose when L is real-valued.\nother: When inputs are on a CUDA device, this function synchronizes that device with the CPU. For a version of this function that does not synchronize, see torch.linalg.cholesky_ex.

Ensure that the wrapper function fully corresponds to the provided function information.\nFunctional Description: The function `torch.cuda.amp.autocast` is deprecated and replaced by `torch.amp.autocast(\"cuda\", args...)`. It allows scripts to run in mixed precision, improving performance while maintaining accuracy. `autocast` serves as a context manager or decorator, wrapping the forward pass(es) of a network and any related loss computations. Tensors can be any type when entering an autocast region, and it is not necessary to manually cast models or inputs to `half()` or `bfloat16()`. The function selects op-specific data types for operations within an autocast region. Backward operations should not be run under autocast, as they execute in the same data type chosen for the corresponding forward operations.\nWrapper Entry Information: autocast(device_type, enabled=True, dtype=None, cache_enabled=True) -> ContextManager\nother: Deprecated in favor of torch.amp.autocast(\"cuda\"). Recommended to use for forward pass and loss computation only. Avoid using for backward passes. State is thread-local. Can be nested with `autocast(enabled=False)` to force a subregion to run in a specific dtype.
